<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<h2 id="an-exhibit-of-markdown">An exhibit of Markdown</h2>

<p><em>Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn’t automatically save itself.</em></p>

<h2 id="basic-formatting">Basic formatting</h2>

<p>Paragraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.</p>

<p>Paragraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of <em>italics</em> and <strong>bold</strong> is supported. This <em>can be <strong>nested</strong> like</em> so.</p>

<h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>

<h3 id="ordered-list">Ordered list</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>A second item</li>
  <li>Number 3</li>
  <li>Ⅳ</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for <a href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm">Roman numeral four</a>.</em></p>

<h3 id="unordered-list">Unordered list</h3>

<ul>
  <li>An item</li>
  <li>Another item</li>
  <li>Yet another item</li>
  <li>And there’s more…</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="paragraph-modifiers">Paragraph modifiers</h2>

<h3 id="code-block">Code block</h3>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inline code</code> to add code into other things.</p>

<h3 id="quote">Quote</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="headings">Headings</h2>

<p>There are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You’ve probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.</p>

<h3 id="headings-can-also-contain-formatting">Headings <em>can</em> also contain <strong>formatting</strong></h3>

<h3 id="they-can-even-contain-inline-code">They can even contain <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inline code</code></h3>

<p>Of course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.</p>

<p>I don’t recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you’re smallest heading isn’t too small, and you’re largest heading isn’t too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.</p>

<h2 id="urls">URLs</h2>

<p>URLs can be made in a handful of ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A named link to <a href="https://www.markitdown.net/">MarkItDown</a>. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+L</code>.</li>
  <li>Another named link to <a href="https://www.markitdown.net/">MarkItDown</a></li>
  <li>Sometimes you just want a URL like <a href="https://www.markitdown.net/">https://www.markitdown.net/</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="horizontal-rule">Horizontal rule</h2>

<p>A horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.</p>

<hr />

<p>It’s sometimes handy for breaking things up.</p>

<h2 id="images">Images</h2>

<p>Markdown can also contain images. I’ll need to add something here sometime.</p>

<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2>

<p>There’s actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">introduction</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">syntax</a> for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.</p>]]></content><author><name>projectSylas</name></author><category term="markdown" /><category term="example" /><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This note demonstrates some of what Markdown is capable of doing.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mathjax Test</title><link href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/markdown/2018/05/26/mathjax-test.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mathjax Test" /><published>2018-05-26T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-05-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://0.0.0.0:4000/markdown/2018/05/26/mathjax-test</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://0.0.0.0:4000/markdown/2018/05/26/mathjax-test.html"><![CDATA[<ul>

<p>Some of you know that we occasionally play for weddings. As you can imagine, we get a LOT of requests for Canon in D, and we discovered that there were no good arrangements available anywhere for piano and cello! Hard to believe given its popularity. So we decided to make our own! We tried to stick as closely to the original as possible (which was written for three violins and basso continuo), and we performed it <em>not</em> at a snail’s pace so the bride can actually make it down the aisle without putting everyone to sleep. 🙊(Yeah, we said it! Nobody likes a slow processional!) Also, the number one complaint about this piece from cellists is always how booooring it is to play because they literally have to play the same 8 bass notes over and over for the entire piece. Problem solved with this arrangement because the cello never has to play the bass! 🙌(The piano does, but we get lots of other fun stuff too so it’s ok!) So for all you musicians out there playing weddings, we hope you enjoy playing this arrangement a little more than the ones you were used to…You can get it from www.musicnotes.com. 😊Be sure to let us know in the comments if you do!</p>

<p>2nd paragraph. <em>Italic</em>, <strong>bold</strong>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">monospace</code>. Itemized lists
look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>this one</li>
  <li>that one</li>
  <li>the other one</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that — not considering the asterisk — the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Block quotes are
written like so.</p>

  <p>They can span multiple paragraphs,
if you like.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., “it’s all
in chapters 12–14”). Three dots … will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. ☺</p>

<h2 id="an-h2-header">An h2 header</h2>

<p>Here’s a numbered list:</p>

<ol>
  <li>first item</li>
  <li>second item</li>
  <li>third item</li>
</ol>

<p>Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here’s a code sample:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Let me re-iterate ...
for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(which makes copying &amp; pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">time</span>
<span class="c1"># Quick, count to ten!
</span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c1"># (but not *too* quick)
</span>    <span class="n">time</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">sleep</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">0.5</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="an-h3-header">An h3 header</h3>

<p>Now a nested list:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First, get these ingredients:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>carrots</li>
      <li>celery</li>
      <li>lentils</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Boil some water.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dump everything in the pot and follow
this algorithm:</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>find wooden spoon
uncover pot
stir
cover pot
balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
wait 10 minutes
goto first step (or shut off burner when done)
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).</p>

<p>Here’s a link to <a href="http://foo.bar">a website</a>, to a <a href="local-doc.html">local
doc</a>, and to a <a href="#an-h2-header">section heading in the current
doc</a>. Here’s a footnote <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Tables can look like this:</p>

<p>Name           Size  Material      Color
————- —–  ————  ————
All Business      9  leather       brown
Roundabout       10  hemp canvas   natural
Cinderella       11  glass         transparent</p>

<p>Table: Shoes sizes, materials, and colors.</p>

<p>(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports
multi-line tables:</p>

<hr />
<p>Keyword   Text
——–  ———————–
red       Sunsets, apples, and
          other red or reddish
          things.</p>

<p>green     Leaves, grass, frogs
          and other things it’s
          not easy being.
——–  ———————–</p>

<p>A horizontal rule follows.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here’s a definition list:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>apples</dt>
  <dd>Good for making applesauce.</dd>
  <dt>oranges</dt>
  <dd>Citrus!</dd>
  <dt>tomatoes</dt>
  <dd>There’s no “e” in tomatoe.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term and  its definition to spread things out more.)</p>

<p>Here’s a “line block” (note how whitespace is honored):</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Line one</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Line too</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Line tree</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>and images can be specified like so:</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9413601/123900693-1d9ebd00-d99c-11eb-8e9e-cf7879187606.png" alt="example image" title="An exemplary image" /></p>

<p>Inline math equation: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line like so:</p>

\[I = \int \rho R^{2} dV\]

<p>And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: `foo`, *bar*, etc.</p>
